## Hi, I'm Alex 👋

- 🇨🇦 I'm a Computer Engineer from Kingston, Ontario.

- ❤️ I'm passionate about cybersecurity, privacy, and hacking.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [nostr-relay](https://github.com/AlexPerrin/nostr-relay), and I'm also architecting an empathy-driven, privacy-centric social media network.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development, leveling up with Go, React, and Tailwind.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on CTF teams, see my [write-ups](https://github.com/AlexPerrin/CTF-Writeups)
