## Hey, I'm Alex 👋

🇨🇦 I'm a Computer Engineer based out of Toronto.

🔭 I’m currently working on [nostr-relay](https://github.com/AlexPerrin/nostr-relay), and I'm also architecting an empathy-driven, privacy-centric social media network.

🌱 I’m currently learning full-stack development, focusing on improving with Go for back-end, and React for front-end.

❤️ I'm passionate about cybersecurity, privacy, and ethical hacking.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on CTF teams, see my [write-ups](https://github.com/AlexPerrin/CTF-Writeups)
